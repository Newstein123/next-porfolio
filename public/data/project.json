Unlike conventional generation apps, our platform offers both static and dynamic QR code generation capabilities. During the QR code creation process, users have the freedom to select their preferred template from a range of options. Reflecting industry standards, predefined templates relevant to various sectors are available. Users retain the flexibility to customize elements such as images, text fields, colors, and background hues, akin to a miniature website builder interface. Presently, our application features a modest selection of six templates, with plans for expansion in the future. Encouraged by this endeavor, I subsequently developed a full-fledged website builder application. Noteworthy is its sophisticated payment system, leveraging the local payment gateway KPay. Users benefit from the convenience of manual payments as well as QR code-based transactions. These insights provide a glimpse into the myriad captivating features encapsulated within our application.",

Additionally, we had to handle manual payment transactions.Language localization, specifically English and Myanmar, was also implemented, allowing for dynamic word changes as needed.Overall, the project took four months to complete, presenting several challenges along the way. However, it stands as a significant achievement in my career."

The system needs to retain the entire conversation history, but due to token limitations, only the last five conversations are remembered. Despite these challenges, the project is both enjoyable and highly beneficial."

To mitigate this expense, a strategic solution was devised: leveraging the URLs of established video uploading services such as YouTube and Mtube.

Another significant adjustment pertained to the restructuring of the reporter role within the system. Originally, the system featured distinct roles for administrators and reporters, with reporters responsible for creating posts and administrators tasked with post approval. However, a revised approach was implemented, granting users dual roles as both regular users and reporters. This modification streamlined the workflow, enhancing user engagement and content creation. Additionally, a minor but noteworthy challenge involved transitioning from Laravel 8 to Laravel 9. While numerous services facilitate instantaneous Laravel version updates, the client opted to forego such solutions due to budgetary considerations. Instead, the transition was managed manually, ensuring seamless compatibility and functionality across the platform. Despite these adjustments, integrating payment gateways and SMS services posed minimal difficulty, with both functionalities seamlessly incorporated into the system architecture. These features enhance user interaction and facilitate financial transactions with ease and efficiency."

			"intro": "The primary challenge within this project lies in understanding the intricate domain knowledge pertaining to fire certificate processes.",
			"short_desc": "Despite my primary responsibilities revolving around tasks such as QR code generation, updating role assignments, and optimizing routing efficiency, I encountered significant hurdles due to the complexity of the project domain. To overcome this obstacle, I underwent a week-long training to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intricate processes involved. Another challenge arose during the uploading of large volumes of data. Initially, the code was designed to facilitate bulk uploads, but this approach proved to be time-consuming. In response, I devised a solution wherein data could be uploaded in sessions, alleviating the need for users to wait for extended periods. This streamlined approach enables users to resume uploading from where they left off, improving overall efficiency and user experience."
